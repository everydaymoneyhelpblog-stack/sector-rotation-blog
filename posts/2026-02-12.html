    <h2>Sector Rotation Analysis: February 12, 2026</h2>

<p>The market regime is currently classified as Selective Rotation, characterized by targeted capital flows into specific sectors rather than broad-based risk-on or risk-off behavior. Leadership breadth remains broad, with 6 out of 10 sectors showing positive RS20D values, indicating moderate participation across the market.</p>

<h3>Sector Leadership</h3>
<p>Energy (XLE) continues to dominate the sector rankings with an RS20D of 17.24%, supported by a strong 20-day performance of +16.98%. Despite its leadership, the sector is showing signs of deceleration, as indicated by its acceleration label of "Decelerating but Strong." Materials (XLB) and Consumer Staples (XLP) follow closely, with RS20D values of 10.30% and 9.25%, respectively. Both sectors also exhibit deceleration in momentum but remain structurally strong.</p>

<p>Industrials (XLI) and Real Estate (XLRE) round out the top five, with RS20D values of 6.86% and 4.83%. Utilities (XLU) also maintains a positive RS20D of 4.32%, reflecting steady performance over the last 20 days.</p>

<h3>Weakness and Underperformance</h3>
<p>On the weaker end of the spectrum, Financials (XLF), Consumer Discretionary (XLY), and Health Care (XLV) are all showing Structural Weakness signals. Financials (XLF) ranks ninth with an RS20D of -2.49%, while Consumer Discretionary (XLY) is the weakest sector with an RS20D of -4.93%. Health Care (XLV) remains flat over the 20-day period (-0.05% RS20D), indicating limited momentum.</p>

<p>Technology (XLK) presents a mixed picture. While it shows a Short-Term Bounce with RS5D at +2.67%, its RS20D remains negative at -2.14%, suggesting structural challenges over the longer term.</p>

<h3>Rotation Signals</h3>
<p>Notably, no sectors are currently accelerating in leadership, as all top-ranked sectors are classified as "Decelerating but Strong." This suggests that while certain sectors remain dominant, their momentum is slowing. Defensive sectors, including Consumer Staples (XLP) and Utilities (XLU), are holding steady but lack acceleration signals.</p>

<p>Cyclical sectors, such as Energy (XLE) and Materials (XLB), are slightly outperforming defensive sectors, with an average RS20D of 5.40% compared to 4.51% for defensives. This indicates selective capital rotation favoring cyclicals, albeit without broad-based momentum.</p>

<h3>Breadth and Regime</h3>
<p>The Broad Leadership classification, with 6 out of 10 sectors showing positive RS20D values, reflects moderate market participation. However, the Selective Rotation regime suggests that capital flows are concentrated in specific sectors rather than distributed evenly across the market.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, the current rotation posture highlights selective strength in Energy, Materials, and Consumer Staples, while Financials, Consumer Discretionary, and Health Care remain structurally weak. The absence of accelerating leadership and the deceleration in top-ranked sectors suggest a cautious market environment. Investors may find opportunities in cyclicals, but broader momentum remains constrained.</p>
