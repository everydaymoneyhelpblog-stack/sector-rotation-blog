    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <h2>Market Context: Selective Rotation with Broad Leadership</h2>
<p>The current market regime is classified as Selective Rotation, characterized by targeted capital flows into specific sectors rather than broad-based risk-taking. Leadership breadth remains broad, with six out of ten sectors showing positive RS20D values, indicating moderate participation across the market.</p>

<h2>Sector Leadership</h2>
<p>Energy (XLE) continues to lead the sector rankings with an RS20D of 17.24%, supported by robust 20-day performance (+16.98%). However, its acceleration label, "Decelerating but Strong," suggests a slowdown in momentum despite its leadership position. Materials (XLB) and Consumer Staples (XLP) follow closely, with RS20D values of 10.30% and 9.25%, respectively. Both sectors exhibit similar deceleration patterns, indicating that while they remain strong, their relative strength is tapering off.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Energy (XLE):</strong> RS20D 17.24%, 20D% +16.98%, Acceleration Label: Decelerating but Strong</li>
  <li><strong>Materials (XLB):</strong> RS20D 10.30%, 20D% +10.03%, Acceleration Label: Decelerating but Strong</li>
  <li><strong>Consumer Staples (XLP):</strong> RS20D 9.25%, 20D% +8.99%, Acceleration Label: Decelerating but Strong</li>
</ul>

<h2>Weakness and Underperformance</h2>
<p>At the bottom of the rankings, Financials (XLF), Consumer Discretionary (XLY), and Health Care (XLV) exhibit structural weakness. Financials (XLF) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) show the most pronounced underperformance, with RS20D values of -2.49% and -4.93%, respectively. Health Care (XLV) is slightly less weak but remains negative on both RS20D (-0.05%) and 20-day performance (-0.31%). Technology (XLK) shows a Short-Term Bounce with RS5D at +2.67%, but its longer-term RS20D remains negative (-2.14%), indicating unresolved structural challenges.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Financials (XLF):</strong> RS20D -2.49%, 20D% -2.75%, Acceleration Label: Structural Weakness</li>
  <li><strong>Consumer Discretionary (XLY):</strong> RS20D -4.93%, 20D% -5.19%, Acceleration Label: Structural Weakness</li>
  <li><strong>Health Care (XLV):</strong> RS20D -0.05%, 20D% -0.31%, Acceleration Label: Structural Weakness</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rotation Signals</h2>
<p>Notable rotation signals include the absence of accelerating leadership across all sectors. Energy (XLE), Materials (XLB), and Consumer Staples (XLP) dominate the rankings but show deceleration in relative strength momentum. Technology (XLK) exhibits a short-term recovery, as evidenced by its positive RS5D (+2.67%), but its longer-term structural weakness persists.</p>

<h2>Breadth and Regime</h2>
<p>The Broad Leadership classification, with six sectors showing positive RS20D values, suggests moderate market participation. Defensive sectors, including Consumer Staples (XLP), Utilities (XLU), and Real Estate (XLRE), maintain steady performance with an average RS20D of 4.51%. Cyclical sectors, led by Energy (XLE) and Materials (XLB), outperform defensives with an average RS20D of 5.40%, indicating selective capital rotation into growth-oriented areas.</p>

<h2>Summary of Rotation Posture</h2>
<p>The current rotation posture reflects selective capital flows into strong-performing sectors like Energy, Materials, and Consumer Staples, albeit with decelerating momentum. Weakness persists in Financials, Consumer Discretionary, and Health Care, while Technology shows mixed signals with short-term recovery but longer-term structural challenges. The Selective Rotation regime and Broad Leadership classification highlight a market environment favoring targeted sector exposure rather than broad-based risk-taking.</p>
