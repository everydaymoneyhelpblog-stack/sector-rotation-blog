    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <h2>Market Context: Selective Rotation and Broad Leadership</h2>
<p>The current market regime is classified as Selective Rotation, characterized by targeted capital flows into specific sectors rather than a broad risk-on or risk-off environment. Leadership breadth is broad, with 6 out of 10 sectors showing positive RS20D values, indicating diverse participation across defensive and cyclical groups.</p>

<h2>Sector Leadership</h2>
<p>Energy (XLE) continues to lead the sector rankings with an RS20D of 17.24%, supported by a strong 20-day performance of 16.98%. However, its acceleration label, "Decelerating but Strong," suggests that momentum is slowing despite its leadership position. Materials (XLB) and Consumer Staples (XLP) rank second and third, with RS20D values of 10.30% and 9.25%, respectively. Both sectors exhibit similar deceleration patterns, indicating that while they remain strong, their upward momentum is moderating.</p>
<p>Industrials (XLI) and Real Estate (XLRE) also show solid RS20D values of 6.86% and 4.83%, respectively, maintaining their positions within the top five sectors. Utilities (XLU) rounds out the top six with an RS20D of 4.32%, reflecting steady performance in defensive areas.</p>

<h2>Weakness and Underperformance</h2>
<p>Technology (XLK) shows mixed signals, with a "Short-Term Bounce" label due to its positive RS5D (2.67%) and 5-day performance (3.51%). However, its RS20D remains negative at -2.14%, indicating structural weakness over the longer timeframe. Financials (XLF) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are among the weakest sectors, with RS20D values of -2.49% and -4.93%, respectively. Both sectors exhibit consistent underperformance across multiple timeframes, signaling entrenched structural weakness.</p>
<p>Health Care (XLV) also shows structural weakness, with an RS20D of -0.05% and minimal short-term improvement, as indicated by its RS5D of -0.70%.</p>

<h2>Rotation Signals</h2>
<p>Notably, no sectors are currently accelerating, as all top-ranked sectors are labeled "Decelerating but Strong." This suggests that while leadership sectors remain robust, their momentum is moderating. Technology (XLK) is the only sector showing a short-term bounce, but its longer-term structural weakness limits its potential for sustained leadership.</p>
<p>Defensive sectors, including Consumer Staples (XLP), Utilities (XLU), and Real Estate (XLRE), maintain moderate strength with an average RS20D of 4.51%. Cyclical sectors, led by Energy (XLE) and Materials (XLB), outperform with an average RS20D of 5.40%, highlighting targeted capital flows into economically sensitive areas.</p>

<h2>Breadth and Regime</h2>
<p>The Broad Leadership classification reflects diverse sector participation, with both defensive and cyclical groups contributing to market strength. This breadth supports the Selective Rotation regime, where capital is flowing into specific sectors rather than a unified market-wide trend. The divergence between defensive and cyclical groups suggests a balanced approach by market participants, with no clear dominance by either group.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The current rotation posture reflects selective capital flows into strong sectors like Energy, Materials, and Consumer Staples, while weaker sectors such as Financials, Consumer Discretionary, and Health Care continue to lag. The absence of accelerating sectors and the prevalence of deceleration labels among leaders suggest a moderating momentum environment. Overall, the market remains in a Selective Rotation regime with broad leadership across defensive and cyclical sectors.</p>
