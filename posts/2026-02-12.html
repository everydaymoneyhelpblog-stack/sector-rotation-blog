    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <h2>Sector Rotation Analysis: February 12, 2026</h2>

<p>The market regime for February 12, 2026, is classified as Selective Rotation, characterized by targeted capital flows into specific sectors rather than broad risk-on or risk-off behavior. Leadership breadth remains broad, with 6 out of 10 sectors showing positive RS20D values, indicating diverse participation across defensive and cyclical groups.</p>

<h3>Sector Leadership</h3>
<p>Energy (XLE) continues to lead the sector rankings with an RS20D of 17.24%, supported by a strong 20-day performance of 16.98%. However, its acceleration label, "Decelerating but Strong," suggests that momentum is slowing despite its leadership position. Materials (XLB) and Consumer Staples (XLP) rank second and third, with RS20D values of 10.30% and 9.25%, respectively. Both sectors exhibit similar deceleration patterns, indicating that while they remain strong, their relative strength is tapering.</p>

<p>Industrials (XLI) and Real Estate (XLRE) also show solid RS20D values of 6.86% and 4.83%, respectively, maintaining their positions within the top five sectors. Utilities (XLU) rounds out the top six with an RS20D of 4.32%, reflecting steady defensive participation.</p>

<h3>Weakness and Underperformance</h3>
<p>Technology (XLK) shows mixed signals, with a "Short-Term Bounce" label due to its positive RS5D (2.67%) and 5-day performance (3.51%). However, its RS20D remains negative at -2.14%, indicating structural weakness over the longer timeframe. Financials (XLF) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are among the weakest sectors, with RS20D values of -2.49% and -4.93%, respectively. Both sectors exhibit consistent underperformance across multiple timeframes, signaling sustained structural weakness.</p>

<p>Health Care (XLV) also falls into the structurally weak category, with an RS20D of -0.05% and minimal short-term momentum (-0.70% RS5D). These sectors are struggling to attract capital flows in the current regime.</p>

<h3>Rotation Signals</h3>
<p>Notable rotation signals include the absence of accelerating sectors, as all top-ranked sectors are labeled "Decelerating but Strong." This suggests that while leadership remains intact, momentum is not building further. Technology's short-term bounce is an exception, but its longer-term weakness limits its broader impact.</p>

<p>Defensive sectors such as Consumer Staples (XLP), Utilities (XLU), and Real Estate (XLRE) maintain steady RS20D values, averaging 4.51%. However, cyclical sectors, led by Energy (XLE) and Materials (XLB), slightly outperform with an average RS20D of 5.40%, reflecting selective capital rotation into growth-oriented areas.</p>

<h3>Breadth and Regime</h3>
<p>The Broad Leadership classification highlights diverse sector participation, with both defensive and cyclical groups contributing positively. This breadth supports the Selective Rotation regime, where capital flows are targeted rather than indiscriminate. The divergence between defensive and cyclical sectors remains modest, with both groups showing relative strength.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The current rotation posture reflects selective capital flows into strong-performing sectors such as Energy, Materials, and Consumer Staples, while structurally weak sectors like Financials, Consumer Discretionary, and Health Care continue to lag. Leadership breadth remains broad, supporting a balanced market environment. No sectors are accelerating, indicating a stable but decelerating leadership dynamic.</p>
